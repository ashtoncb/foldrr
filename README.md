### Contribution guidelines ###

* We should probably discuss and outline these...
* I think for right now, it's probably best for each individual to fork his/her own branch and make changes there. Once you feel you have a significant amount of work stored there, we can all meet, discuss the changes, and then incorporate the changes into the master branch.

### Organization ###
	* bin		- directory housing run code
	* src		- directory that will house various modules for calling within run code
	* data		- directories housing various inputs and outputs 
	* tests		- will house code tests

### Who do I talk to? ###

* We should probably also establish who the admins should be for this too...
